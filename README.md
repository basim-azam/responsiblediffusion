RIDD introduces a novel **plug-and-play** framework for interpretable and responsible text-to-image (T2I) generation. Our approach **enables fine-grained control over generated images** by dynamically adjusting attributes such as **age, gender, and race** while maintaining fidelity and fairness in AI-generated content.

## **Introduction**
The rapid advancement in **diffusion models** has enabled high-quality text-to-image synthesis. However, **interpretability, fairness, and responsible generation** remain key challenges. **RIDD** addresses these challenges by:
- Providing **fine-grained control** over attributes like **age, gender, and race**.
- Using **knowledge distillation** and **concept whitening** for interpretable changes.
- Ensuring **responsible AI** by mitigating biases in generated images.
