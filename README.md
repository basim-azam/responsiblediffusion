# RIDD: Plug-and-Play Interpretable Responsible Text-to-Image Generation

RIDD introduces a novel **plug-and-play** framework for interpretable and responsible text-to-image (T2I) generation. Our approach **enables fine-grained control over generated images** by dynamically adjusting attributes such as **age, gender, and race** while maintaining fidelity and fairness in AI-generated content.

## **Introduction**
The rapid advancement in **diffusion models** has enabled high-quality text-to-image synthesis. However, **interpretability, fairness, and responsible generation** remain key challenges. **RIDD** addresses these challenges by:
- Providing **fine-grained control** over attributes like **age, gender, and race**.
- Using **knowledge distillation** and **concept whitening** for interpretable changes.
- Ensuring **responsible AI** by mitigating biases in generated images.

## **Features**
âœ… **Plug-and-play concept control** - Users can modify age, gender, and race dynamically.  
âœ… **Dual-space multi-facet control** - Combines concept whitening and knowledge distillation.  
âœ… **Intuitive UI** - Uses a **slider-based control** to progressively modify generated images.  
âœ… **Fair and responsible AI** - Prevents unintended biases in diffusion-based models.  
âœ… **ArXiv Paper, Code, and Interactive Demo** available for deeper exploration.
